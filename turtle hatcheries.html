      <h2>About Turtle Hatcheries</h2>
      <p>Hatcheries can be utilized as a technique for ex situ conservation, but it is hotly disputed whether or not they help 
        with effective management of sea turtle populations. The seven hatcheries that are now operating in Sri Lanka were 
        evaluated using a questionnaire survey. Private owners ran every hatchery, and ecotourism profits were their main 
        source of income. Hatcheries just started operating all year round, as opposed to the 1990s when they were only open 
        during the tourist season. It was standard procedure to purchase sea turtle eggs from egg collectors for an average price 
        of 8 to 15 LKR (approximately 0.15 USD) per and bury them inside a hatchery's incubation enclosure. At all hatcheries, 
        "headstarting" took place. Despite being frequently cleaned, the majority of the rearing tanks were packed during the 
        turtle breeding season. When feeding grew too expensive, young and sub-adult turtles that had been maintained for 
        exhibition were frequently released into the ocean. None of the hatcheries participated in any joint research projects
         or offered visitor programs that aided in sea turtle conservation; rather, their operations served as tourist attractions
          and sources of cash for the community.
